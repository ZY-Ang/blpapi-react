## blpapi-react
A web application that demonstrates [Bloomberg's API](http://www.bloomberglabs.com/api/) by sending HTTP requests and visualizing the returned data. <br>
It was built with React, Flux, and Node.js.

### Demonstration
Running this requires a subscription to the Bloomberg Terminal. If you don't have one, you're not out of luck! <br>

### Nifty Features
* **Request History:** Click that history button, and get a list of all of the requests you've sent. The application caches *every* request you make, so you can check out how the data changes over time!
* **Raw Request Toggling:** Hit up that checkbox to toggle between an "assisted" request and a raw request. POST body and all!
* **Cool Tabs:** Tap those rad red tabs to toggle between seeing the POST body, the raw response, a prettyfied response, and the response data itself!
* **Charts Galore:** The charts used to vizualize historical data requests can take a lot of data, so add as many securities, fields, and dates as you'd like!
